## Kinetic or dynamic friction


-We already know that static frictional force exists between two surfaces in contact before there is relative motion between two surfaces  
-When applied force becomes greater then limiting friction force,then motion of the body starts and kinetic friction comes into existence  
-Thus when bodies in contact moves relative to each other then friction developed between them is called kinetic or dynamic friction  
-Consider the figure below in which a block of mass m is kept over the surface S  
-Initially the block is at rest,now we push the block on the surface such that it begins to move or start sliding on the surface  
-When the block is sliding over the surface each body exerts a frictional force on the other side parallel to the surface in contact  
-The Force of friction acting on the block B due to surface S is along the direction opposite to the motion of B with respect to S.Thus force of kinetic friction opposes the relative motion between the bodies in motion  
-The frictional force acting on the block is along the direction towards the left and an equal force acts on the surface S directed towards the rights  
-Thus we can say that sliding friction on a body B against surface S is opposite to the velocity of the body B with respect to S

## Laws of Chemical Combination

There are two main laws of Chemical Combination as established by Lavoisier and Joseph L. Proust.  
(a)Law of Conservation of Mass  
(b) Law of constant or definite proportion

## Dalton's atomic theory

There was explanation for the above theories.
British chemist John Dalton proposed the atomic theory which provided the explanation for the above laws  
-All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms.  
-Atoms are indivisible particles  
-Atoms can neither be created nor be destroyed  
-Atoms of same elements are similar.  
-Atoms of different elements are different.  
-Atoms combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to form compounds.  
-The relative number and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound.

## What is an Atom

-Matter is made up of Atoms  
-Atom are the smallest particle of elements  
-Atoms are very small, they are smaller than anything that we can imagine or compare with.

## What is Molecule

A molecule is a group of two or more atoms chemically bonded together. The atoms with in the molecules are held of force of attraction.  
It is smallest particle of an element or a compound that is capable of an free state and that has all the properties of that substance.

## Ions

-Compounds composed of metals and non-metals contain charged species  
-The charged species are known as ions.  
-An ion is a charged particle and can be negatively or positively charged.  
-Anions are negatively charged ion while cations are the positively charged ion  
-Anions are formed by gain of electrons while cations are formed by loss of electrons

## Introduction

-In our daily life ,we see lots of things moving around for example car passing through from one place to other, person riding on a bicycle and many more like this.  
-In scientific terms an object is said to be in motion ,if it changes its position with the description of time and if it does not change it position with the passage of time then it is said to be at rest  
-Both the motion and rest are relative terms.  
-Simplest case of motion is rectilinear motion which is the motion of the object in a straight line or one dimension  
-In our description of object ,we will treat the object as an point object.  
-Object under consideration can be treated as point object if the size of the object is much smaller than the distance travelled by it in a reasonable time duration for example length of a motor car travelling a distance of 500 km can be neglected w.r.t distance travelled by it.  
-Here in kinematics ,we study ways to describe the motion without going into the cause of the motion.

## Position

-To locate the position in motion or at rest,we need a frame of reference.  
-We know that we need a frame of reference is needed to locate the position of any object. For that we choose rectangular co-ordinate system of three mutually perpendicular axis that are
x
,
y
and
z
axis. The point of intersection of these three axes is called Origin 'O' and is considered as the Reference Point.
The
x
,
y
and
z
co-ordinates describe the position of object with respect to the co-ordinate system. To measure time , we need a clock. The co-ordinate system along with a clock constitutes a Frame of reference. So , the frame of reference is a co-ordinate system , with a clock w.r.t. which, an observer can describe the position, displacement etc. of an object.
